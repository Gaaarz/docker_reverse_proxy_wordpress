# How to setup a reverse proxy and wordpress with a docker compose

First of all you need along with docker the [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) install.

## Git clone
Download a copy of the app with `git clone`
```
git clone https://github.com/Gaaarz/docker_reverse_proxy_wordpress ~/docker/
```
## Getting started
### Create a seperate network:
I called this simply "network". You need to change in the docker compose file as well if you change it to your own network name
```
sudo docker network create network
```
### Set your variables domain and email:
```
domain=yourdomain.com
```
```
email=your@email.com
```
Generating a NGINX config for the given domain for our reverse-proxy
```
[ -f ./nginx-conf/nginx.conf-sample ] && cat ./nginx-conf/nginx.conf-sample | sed "s/ROOT_DOMAIN/$domain/" > ./nginx-conf/nginx.conf
```

### Generating a dummy certificate and private key for NGINX to start service
```
dirname=$(echo $(basename $(pwd)) | sed "s/\.//")
```
```
path=/var/lib/docker/volumes/${dirname}_certbot/_data/live/$domain/
```
```
sudo mkdir -p $path
```
```
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -days 1 -keyout ${path}privkey.pem -out ${path}fullchain.pem -subj '/CN=localhost'
```
Now we need to start the NGINX to pull the dummy certificates (you need to be in the /reverse-proxy/-folder)
```
sudo docker compose up -d
```
After startup wait round about 20 sec and remove the dummy certificates and private key to prepare they way for new signed TLS certificates with certbot
```
sudo rm -r $(dirname $path)
```
### Now we can request signed TLS certificate with certbot and restart NGINX to lead the new certificate
```
sudo docker compose run --rm --entrypoint "certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path=/var/www/html --email $email --agree-tos --eff-email --force-renewal -d $domain -d www.$domain" certbot
```
```
sudo docker-compose restart nginx
```
```
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Starting compose
Now you can start both compose files as you wish
```
sudo docker compose up -d
```
```
sudo docker compose down
```

## PS:
DonÂ´t forget to change your passwords in the /website/docker-compose.yml file.

Cheers
